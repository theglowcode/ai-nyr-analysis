The-False-Emperor,">She caused the murder of her father. She caused one of the worst wars in the history of planetos is what she did.

You know, I'd sooner blame a lot of people for this.

Say, I'd blame Rhaegar. Always a safe bet, that.

After all, it was Rhaegar who should've known what Aerys was being as he was actually around the murderous shizo case, being his son and the head of his opposition at court; who was a grown-ass man who should've known better than he did.

Or even Brandon, who rushed into King's Landing seemingly entirely without a plan save to demand to kill the eldest son and heir of the Mad King in their center of power.

Or you know, Aerys himself. I'd argue he was *the most* responsible one when it comes to Rickard's murder and starting the war, since really, someone who had encountered Aerys like the one time may well not assume he's enough of a shizo to murder the Lord of Winterfell and his heir.  
Bro was wired differently from other humans, something was genuinely wrong in that head.

And then he went on to try to murder another heir of Winterfell + the Lord of Storm's End who straight up did nothing to deserve a death sentence--like how do you possibly predict this without extensive exposure to Aerys's bullshit?

Key-Advertising5467,"Back in 2025 (weird to say this because I can't believe it's 2026) I started feeling lonely. Lonely because my best friend lives hours away, and I had to distance myself from some irl acquaintances because I used to be bullied in school and they were the ""popular jocks"". I graduated in July '24. 

Ever since my mental health started declining because I couldn't leave the house due to some health problems. So I started relying on the roleplay chatbots... then I'd start reminiscing about my teenage years and how I could've handled them better. 

Until november. I've had enough and deleted the app but relapsed a month later. For 2026 I promised myself I would heal and get over my social anxiety and try befriending... so today I finally deleted my 2+ year old account. And I started feeling free. I am going to try applying for college next year to pursue my hobbies, and actually live life. Feels nice to finally make future plans when I've been so numb.",Reddit Submission,Jan 01 13:58:53 2026,,,

Historical_Sell6245,"Honestly, the reason we forget resolutions is that a 'promise' to yourself is just words—and words fade.

This year, I’m treating my goals like a **Master Script** rather than a to-do list. I’ve started 'storyboarding' my months by creating an AI image of my 'Hero Shot' (the goal achieved) on day one; it makes the vision feel like a memory I'm chasing rather than a chore I'm avoiding.

I’ve also ditched the future-tense 'I will' and started writing **Weekly Monologues** in the past tense on Sunday nights. Writing my week as if it already happened and I crushed it turns the hype into a narrative I’m just fulfilling—it’s much harder to forget your goals when you’re already living the script.",Reddit Comment,Jan 01 13:55:39 2026,,,

— Fight your addiction to short videos, find relaxation in quality games, movies, and, Lord forgive me, reading...

— Eat well, get enough sleep, and minimize stress — the latter is especially harmful to your health.

— Gather the strength to travel to another country. Can't do it? Go to another city; a change of scenery is great for refreshing your mind.

— Ask yourself every day: what have I done to make tomorrow better?

— Pay attention to your family; no one else needs you but them.

— Take risks: in business, in relationships, in tastes. The path to the greatest reward lies only through risk. The only thing worse than failing is not trying.

Having instantly failed my new Year resolutions there is no pressure to stick to any resolutions.

I have been investing for the last two years majority of which is in debt and that too in FD. I have also been doing SIP in Nifty50 for 2 years but the amount is small . Since repo rates have gone down and me being in a higher tax bracket I feel the need to diversify my investment and take more risk if i need to get good returns in long term, So I have made a new year resolution to diversify my portfolio for 2026 and put more money in equity via MF SIP. This is what I have curated as a moderate investor based on my research of last 10 days. Please provide your valuable suggestions and alternatives if you have any. Apart from this I have also planned for 10K (60:30) in Gold & Silver ETF.

wladyslawmalkowicz,"Hey SG redditors, it's the first day of the year and I sincerely wish everyone a very eventful year ahead with all of your realizing wishes and new year resolutions :) 

And now here's the thing, there's no doubt that dating app fatigue is getting more and more entrenched (I don't think there will be many detractors) so perhaps dating apps might not cut it for 2026 anymore. If so, what are ways that you're planning to adopt to put yourselves out there and be in the dating pool? 

The thing with dating apps are that many people on it (both guys and girls) are using it the ""wrong way"" and they are plagued by what I call as the illusion of having many choices, and with that, everyone that you are going out with and giving a try will just be dismissed summarily at the slightest hint of some perceived incompatibility. What gives us this confidence to dismiss someone, it's exactly that, the illusion of choices!! As a guy, I will really love to bring back the old fashioned way in which you have a target, and you try your best courting her, and fortunately, I do have a target and I feel so liberated from being afflicted by the trappings of dating apps.

Apart from this I have also planned for 10K (60:30) in Gold & Silver ETF.",Reddit Submission,Jan 01 11:51:07 2026,,,

SpooferGirl,"It doesn’t matter what you asked. People can comment whatever they want, you can’t control the responses you get when posting on an open forum as I already said. You can try and tell people what you want all you like, that’s not how it works because others have opinions. If you aren’t prepared for all sorts of responses, don’t post. 

People posted out of concern for what to most looks like a pretty wild list of resolutions - resolutions generally being things we are going to achieve to completion, not just a guideline for things to work on in life. I know you replied to me to clarify but others obviously didn’t read that. 

Nobody is being nasty to you, there are no ‘negative’ comments, they just think your list is unrealistic - I think you’re over-reacting a bit here and your preachy ‘I achieved loads in 2025 so I’m going to continue and won’t be reading any more negativity’ was rude. We don’t know that. We don’t know these are just generic goals. You’ve literally labelled them ‘New Year Resolutions’ - the title would indicate you plan to start today, not that you already started a year ago. Your OP says ‘you wrote down your resolutions *for the new year*.

‘Launch ‘business’ by Spring’ - it’s not exactly a wild assumption to read that and assume you are planning to start a business in the next four months. Nowhere does it mention you already have a business and it’s just a product launch. 

People saw a typical impulsive ‘I’m going to completely turn my life around’ list and were showing concern that you’re taking on too much and will end up beating yourself up when you don’t achieve everything in full - because that’s what we do, probably that’s what most people who set ‘New Year’ resolutions do unless they’re forgotten after a week (like my husband who didn’t call it a resolution but planned to have a ‘dry’ January - we’re both sober so he’s talking about food, I laughed and said ‘what, dry and tasteless?’ and he rolled his eyes.. and at 12.33am, literally the first thing he ate this year, it was pizza). Your OP was short and vague and did not include any of the information you then replied to posts with. 

And you also got a bunch of comments breaking down your specific examples - but instead, you chose to focus on what you perceive to be negative. 

If you achieved so much in 2025 then why are you asking how to achieve in 2026? Just do what you did last year 🤷‍♀️",Reddit Comment,Jan 01 11:29:19 2026,,,

📚Todays lesson📚 : In world war 2 a german soldier who was captured by Soviet soldiers was forced to play the piano and if he stopped they'd kill him. It is believe he played for somewhere between 16 and 22 hours before collapsing from exhaustion. They soldiers apparently patted him on the back and congratulated him on his performance and continued to drag him away and shoot him as they said they would.

With that said, if you are so stressed that it’s affecting your life and tipping you to depression then cutting down the visits is just self preservation. And you shouldn’t feel guilty about it. Plus you are married and you need to consider your husband’s needs as well. 

 I was thinking about what if something happened to me or my husband and I really feel regret that I’ve let my mother take so much time away from us with her endless needs.

CankleDankl,"Rookie Arena is pretty much worthless. Only really worth doing for dailies and weeklies or testing out new comps. SP arena is where all the rewards are. 10k arena tickets daily, 2k+ gems every other week if you set your squads up right.

And yes, the list is still correct. Jackal is *the* arena unit, and new vesti is an incredible B3 for arena. Now as for your question:

Noah is one of the best B2s. She gens crazy amounts of burst, taunts enemies when she bursts, and turns literally invincible during that time. So unless your opponent has AoE/full squad damage, it is impossible to die.

Biscuit is often put alongside Jackal as the two most influential Arena units. Squads are build around *them*. You typically don't wanna put them on the same squad as it's overkill and they're best spread out, but yeah Biscuit is a mainstay

You can see the tier list, but others that are good are Anis (for burst gen), Centi (for burst gen), Blanc (for heals), and Trina (for acting as a budget Biscuit for Scarlet and Moran. Also burst gen)

Building for arena is a pain in the ass and it uses a lot of units that are generally... well, awful in PvE content. Best of luck climbing the ladder and getting that gem income. It's a substantial amount of the renewable gems you can make in the game",Reddit Comment,Jan 01 10:54:43 2026,,,

Funnily enough I too make super whimsical resolutions too…and I weirdly follow through because they’re always non-serious ones!

This year I want to start making pants! I picked up sewing and pattern making a few years ago. I can make (cloth) bags, dresses, skirts and tops already. This year I want to focus on pants!! Since they’re structured garments with little room for error, I want to tackle the challenge head on.

Well, this year I want to write a book even if is the most mediocre piece of writing out there, even if the book is just a bad fan fiction about X novel that unconsciously my brain has plagiarized without me knowing it, even if it's the most costumbrist and cliche novel of it's genre, even if no one ever is gonna read it apart from me and the couple friends I manage to get into reading it

This is most of a self determination post, when my will weakens I want to come here and read this words out loud. But I also ask for advice, even if it's strategies that didn't work out for you but seems legit and useful.

LittleAnxiety3342,"There were so many things that happened in the past year. Good and bad, both. I've disappointed people and vice versa. I've had truly great times as well. Last year made me realise something very important.

I've been struggling with understanding myself and what I want. Until last night, I didn't even think about the new year, resolutions, I didn't even care. But something happened, something changed without me consciously doing anything. I've tried so many times to be with people, to connect to them and it always ends up the same way– me leaving because of my issues and making them upset. Heartbroken, even. And I hate to do that but I can't just stay. At this point, I don't even make new friends online or in real life because I know what's going to happen. 

It's always been like that on a loop. Meet someone new, talk to them and realise I cannot handle trusting people completely and being attached to them. And then I leave. There's a part of me, a huge part that hates losing control of whatever situation I'm in. It makes me uneasy, the kind of uneasiness I can't handle. So, I lose interest and then, I leave. Of course, after that I feel alone and then I try talking to a new person. Because there's always that hope that perhaps now, it will be different. Maybe I'll finally find peace with someone. But it never comes. I can't take this hurt anymore, I can't let things like this keep happening. 

And I've accepted it. It's okay if that kind of peace and love is not for me. It's okay if I can't be close to anyone without hurting them and myself and inevitably leaving. I'm okay with not having that at all, I can live without that. Being alone is the best for me. I'm going to embrace it, work on myself, get rid of the insecurities and do what I really want to do. 

Cheers to the new year and a more sensible me! Wish you all a very happy new year!!",Reddit Submission,Jan 01 10:04:10 2026,,,

perefourras,"Hi and happy new year!

I have a 1 stage Carrier furnace (59SC5B) and this thing is just too loud and heats up our house too quickly (\~2000 sqft). It’s loud, and some small rooms are heated up too quickly. I’d like to get something that is significantly quieter, and can operate at a lower regime.

A two stage furnace seems like a good option.

What are good solutions? What questions should I ask as I start to get some quotes?

The current furnace works well, so I feel bad for changing something that’s actually working. But I’m looking for something more comfortable for our family.

Thanks for your help.",Reddit Submission,Jan 01 08:39:37 2026,,,

kingofpyrates,"happy new year everyone.

every year i write new year resolutions with full motivation, thinking this time it’ll stick.

and every year, about a month later, i genuinely can’t remember what i wrote.

once the initial excitement fades, the goals just disappear from daily life.



i ended up building a small personal tool called lockin26 to experiment with this idea,

but the bigger thing i’ve been thinking about is the product question behind it.



how much of “consistency” is really about motivation,

and how much is just about resurfacing the right things at the right time?



curious how other builders here think about reminder-based or resurfacing mechanics,

have you seen them work well long-term, or do users eventually tune them out?",Reddit Submission,Jan 01 07:35:17 2026,,,

Like, we will teach how to write information neatly and cleanly on A5-size (as given in the CAT exam hall) paper when too much information is given in the LR/DI Set, which will strengthen your basics completely.

I'm tired of doing the same old ""eat healthy, workout everyday, save more"" resolutions since they're not fun and I can barely keep up with them, if at all.

I'm not a pasta fan but I loved the idea of doing fun resolutions. Things that are whimsical, fun and stuff you actually want to do. For now these are what I have:

1. I want to watch 25 romcoms I've never watched before (please drop your recommendations, any language works!)
2. I want to read one book a month from my physical stash.
3. Finish one embroidery project from Emillie Ferris's book. 
4. I want to finish up one Bath and Body Works Candle I own.

kingofpyrates,"for years, my pattern was always the same.

january started with motivation, lists, and big intentions.

by february, i genuinely couldn’t remember what i had promised myself.



at first i thought the issue was discipline or willpower.

but after repeating this cycle for years, i realised something simpler:

once the initial excitement faded, the goals disappeared from my daily awareness.



this year, the biggest change for me has been treating goals like something that needs to be revisited regularly, not something you write once and hope sticks.

it’s not exciting, but it feels much more sustainable than relying on motivation alone.

RoninBalor,NEW YEAR Resolution?,Reddit Comment,Jan 01 07:04:09 2026,,,
Main_Internal_7017,"Every year on Jan 1, people write the same things:

* “I want to earn more”
* “I want to be healthier”
* “I want to grow my business”
* “I want to be consistent”

And every year, most of it collapses by February.

Here’s what actually helped me (and others I’ve seen succeed):

**From Day 1 of 2026, don’t write what you want. Write what you’re willing to tolerate.**

Because your year won’t be defined by motivation.  
It will be defined by what you *allow to continue*.

Here are the 5 things worth writing on Jan 1:



**1. Write the behaviors you will no longer excuse**  
Not habits you want to build.  
Habits you’re done justifying.

Examples:

* “I stop saying I’m busy when I’m actually avoiding.”
* “I stop calling inconsistency ‘flexibility’.”
* “I stop blaming tools, algorithms, or people.”

If you don’t write this down, you’ll repeat it unconsciously.



**2. Write your personal “non-negotiables” (not goals)**  
Goals change. Standards don’t.

Examples:

* “I do the work even when results aren’t visible.”
* “I don’t abandon things halfway anymore.”
* “I finish what I start, even imperfectly.”

This matters more than ambition.



**3. Write what you will do on low-energy days**  
Most plans only work on high-motivation days.  
Those days are rare.

Write rules like:

* “On bad days, I still show up for 30 minutes.”
* “I don’t quit because a day was wasted.”

This single shift prevents 80% of failure.



**4. Write the distractions you’re consciously choosing to keep**  
Be honest. You’re not quitting everything.

Write:

* What you will still waste time on
* How much time you’ll allow
* When it becomes a problem again

If you don’t define it, distraction quietly becomes your lifestyle.



**5. Write one sentence you’ll reread when you want to quit**  
Not motivational. Real.

Examples:

* “Future me is built by boring repetition.”
* “Discomfort now is easier than regret later.”
* “This feeling passes. Quitting compounds.”

This sentence matters more than any planner.



**Final thought:**  
A successful 2026 won’t come from better planning.  
It will come from **less self-betrayal**.

If you write anything on Day 1, write the truth — not the fantasy.

wellnessrelay,"A lot of this sounds less like a motivation problem and more like too much freedom at once. I have broken plenty of resolutions by trying to fix everything at the same time. What helped me was picking one or two keystone habits and letting the rest follow instead of forcing a full life overhaul. Sleep is usually the quiet foundation for everything else, even if it feels boring to start there. I also stopped aiming for perfect streaks and focused on getting back on track quickly when I slipped. Progress felt more real once I treated it like practice instead of a test.

I picked one small habit for January, and I’m not adding anything new until it feels automatic. Then in February, I’ll layer in another one - and so on. Nothing huge, just simple things like consistent sleep, daily planning, short workouts, reading, etc.

# stats

height: 6’2 / 188 cm

weight: 79 kg / \~174 lbs

build: slim to athletic

shipping: **eastmallbuy**

line: **gd ems**

destination: singapore but travelling to europe and japan so need winter shi

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

this was a pretty big mixed haul, mostly winter pieces with some shoes and accessories. everything shipped via eastmallbuy using gd ems and it landed before new years which honestly surprised me in a good way. no damage, no missing items, and packaging was solid overall. a lot of these were bought through yupoo sellers and i used the agent to handle purchasing since some listings are annoying with blurred thumbnails. fit notes below are based on my stats above.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# footwear

**black air force 1 max batch eu 47.5**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215731697?uid=1](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215731697?uid=1)

classic. shape is right, leather feels solid, and they fit my big feet properly which is always the main concern. max batch didn’t disappoint. these are beaters but still look clean.

**ultra boost 1 style eu 47.5**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/169263435?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4634383](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/169263435?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4634383)

actually shocked by these. comfort is insanely close to my retail ultra boost 1. boost feel, knit, and overall flex are almost identical. if you told me these were retail on foot i wouldn’t question it.

**mm6 gx batch salmon eu 46.5**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/214075197?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4512899](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/214075197?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4512899)

good shoe. color pops hard but still wearable. gx batch quality is solid and build feels premium. fits slightly snug so sizing down half was the right call.

**ugg x palace top batch for my girl**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215963143?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4679819](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215963143?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4679819)

not for me but quality is there. suede feels soft, stitching clean, and shape matches retail refs well.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# underwear

**spider boxers size xl**

yupoo: [https://lemonvip.x.yupoo.com/albums/186083805?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4952719](https://lemonvip.x.yupoo.com/albums/186083805?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4952719)

soft, stretchy, and comfortable. branding looks fine and fit is good for xl. nothing crazy but solid daily wear.

really clean zip up. fabric is thick, zip feels smooth, and fit is relaxed without being huge. easy layering piece.

**derschutze blossom long sleeve size xl**

yupoo: [https://lemonvip.x.yupoo.com/albums/210289436?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=5015696](https://lemonvip.x.yupoo.com/albums/210289436?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=5015696)

print is nice and not overly glossy. fabric has some weight to it and sizing works well on longer arms.

**represent money hoodie size xl**

yupoo: [https://lemonvip.x.yupoo.com/albums/211346155?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4713326](https://lemonvip.x.yupoo.com/albums/211346155?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4713326)

same comfort level as the money hoodie. red logo pops nicely on the grey and print quality is solid.

**palace crewneck black size xl**

classic palace. thick blank, clean logo placement, and a slightly boxy fit that works well with cargos or denim.

**bape grey crewneck size xxl**

yupoo: [https://repapestore.x.yupoo.com/albums/213079759?uid=1](https://repapestore.x.yupoo.com/albums/213079759?uid=1)

went xxl for a relaxed fit and it worked out perfectly. material is warm, logo embroidery is clean, and grey tone looks accurate.

Everything you pointed out was spot on! I actually run an additional AI pass to make these prompts more readable for everyday users. The capitalized letters you mentioned were intentional—they spell out ""S-M-A-R-T"" from the classic goal-setting framework. The same goes for using | to create table-like visuals; I find it makes the underlying system prompt much easier for non-technical users to scan and understand.

Delta_DG_,"It’s New Year.

Day one of the chapter called 2026.

And honestly… it doesn’t feel any different. It just feels like another day.

There are no fears.

No regrets either.

Just this quiet feeling that says yeah, it was time well spent.

Learned a lot of things. Lost a lot of friends. Found a few new bonds.

In its own way, it was all worth it.

So now what?

That’s the question I have.

But I don’t really want to find the answer.

It’s strange this New Year doesn’t come with wonder or excitement.

It feels like only the date has changed.

What is there to celebrate, really?

And that’s not a bad thing.

It’s just this numb feeling that’s holding everything together.

It’s not just the New Year it’s my birthday too.

Yeah… I know.

But it’s not that exciting, to be honest.

Is this maturity?

Or just growing older?

There will be no New Year resolutions.

No new goals.

I’ll let fate decide the path it has built for me with all its flows and imperfections,

with its beautiful surprises and harsh lessons.

Whatever is waiting for me…

No more regrets.

No more questions.

Prepared this year with his 4 books, they are useless, Quant repetitive in scopes that are outdated, and the two DI and LR are even more confusing to use. 

Here's a ragtag prep style -- start with Revision Videos (long 4-7 hr) live streams from CrackU, for Quant and Verbal as you deem fit and start attempting mocks. 

If someone recommends IMS mocks, I would say do not use them, because the platform and everything is amazing, but the solutions are not, which means you are driving to nowhere.

Butlerianpeasant,"I’ve found that New Year’s resolutions can work — but only when the goal shifts from “changing everything all at once” to “changing one thing that matters… and making it stick.”

A few Stoic lessons that helped me:
1️⃣ Don’t fight your whole life at once.
Pick one habit that, if improved, would make everything else easier. Not “delete all apps,” but, for example:
20 minutes of reading before any social media.
Win that battle daily — momentum grows.

2️⃣ Trade restriction for replacement.
The Stoics didn’t avoid distraction by gritting teeth. They filled their attention with what nourished them.
Add before removing. Build before cutting.

3️⃣ Treat relapse as part of the design.
On day 3–4, most people fail… because they expect perfection.
A setback isn’t failure — it’s training.
Return to the path. That’s Stoicism.

4️⃣ Identity > motivation.
Instead of “I want to quit scrolling,” try:
I’m someone who chooses what deserves my attention.
Your actions begin to follow the story you tell.

5️⃣ Keep it fun, not punitive.
The Greeks trained their minds the way athletes trained their bodies — with joy in the process, not punishment for imperfection.

Every year gives us another chance to practice the same eternal truth:
Discipline isn’t a January event.

It’s a daily vote for the person you are becoming.

Wherever you start — start small, start kind, start now.

A happy new year, and may you win your battles in 2026 — not because you never fall, but because you always rise.",Reddit Comment,Jan 01 05:36:09 2026,,,

Stunning-House988,"Happy new year everyone!!! 🥳

I made a bingo card based on Ilya and Shane (based on the show episodes) with similar activities they do in the show. I tried to choose activities that would well suit ""New Year resolution goals"" and that can be done just for fun 🥹 I do realize that some of the activities might not be the easiest to do, like the visiting cities ones. You can definitely replace any of the activities with ones that better suit your interests/plans for the year! And I tried to keep them pretty flexible, so for example, ""watch a hockey game"" can mean either in-person or through a screen.

Anyways, I hope this brings a little bit of joy to your life and convinces you to touch grass because this show (and the winter weather and the holidays) has been keeping me indoors which isn't super great for my mental health... And I want us to be able to enjoy the HR experience out into our lives too :)

**I wish you all a wonderful 2026!!!**

Kind_Computer_446,"I liked your prompt but few things I wanna say that this prompt MIGHT BE AI generated or might be have problems you might have missed. You can improve these later on.

First of all it has strange syntaxes. 

For example in some texts it has this suppose there is something like ***Measurable***, but has syntax of ***M***easerable. Which is not necessary in A PROMPT. You could use capitalisation( Like ***MEASURABLE***), it saves token as AI does have to convert the ***M***easurable into Measurable.

Also the prompt has strange tables which I think ain't necessary, as they reduce context by forcing the AI to unnecessarily convert your table into a normal readable JSON data, and it burns token. 
It used ""|""  syntax for separating tasks, and sections. Which is also unnecessary, The AI ignores them, as they're not trained in data which uses "" | "" for separating tasks. You can use dashes like ""---"" to separates data or you can some just use brackets {...} or  [...]. As AIs are trained in a vast amount JSON DATA. 

Overall, I was just trying to advice your prompt, so that you can improve your prompt expertise. And I said it might be AI as AI uses strange tables, or strange syntaxes for generating a prompt. (Please don't mean it)

But yea, if you wrote the prompt, then your prompt was actually good, but I was just trying to say DON'T stop here, there's lot of room to improve. 
You could say, I was having an itch to advice someone for no reason that's why I advised you, JUST IGNORE IT, if you don't wanna listen to my advice (it's okay if you don't - just killing some time of  mine to do some good things instead of scrolling)",Reddit Comment,Jan 01 04:48:21 2026,,,

ConnorXwolf,"This word is the Chinese word “ru”

The meaning is a little bit complex. It comes from Buddhism and Taoism

Buddhism defines ""ru"" as the fundamental, unchanging essence of all things. 

One of the Taoism Bible Tao Te Ching states, ""The highest goodness is like water, which benefits all things without striving, and avoids what others despise, thus nearing the Tao... For only by not striving can there be no blame."" 
Here, ""ru"" also represents ""like.""

My hope for 2026 is to continue on the path of ""rediscovering my true self” and engaging more with the physical world. I want to interacting with all things and people in a more natural way.

I also hope I could be more “like water”. Whether it’s for others or myself, I want to be more adapting flexibly to situations. To flow with the environment, changing like water, yet remaining grounded in my core self.",Reddit Submission,Jan 01 04:27:08 2026,,,
