You know, I'd sooner blame a lot of people for this.

Say, I'd blame Rhaegar. Always a safe bet, that.

After all, it was Rhaegar who should've known what Aerys was being as he was actually around the murderous shizo case, being his son and the head of his opposition at court; who was a grown-ass man who should've known better than he did.

Or even Brandon, who rushed into King's Landing seemingly entirely without a plan save to demand to kill the eldest son and heir of the Mad King in their center of power.

Or you know, Aerys himself. I'd argue he was *the most* responsible one when it comes to Rickard's murder and starting the war, since really, someone who had encountered Aerys like the one time may well not assume he's enough of a shizo to murder the Lord of Winterfell and his heir.  
Bro was wired differently from other humans, something was genuinely wrong in that head.

And then he went on to try to murder another heir of Winterfell + the Lord of Storm's End who straight up did nothing to deserve a death sentence--like how do you possibly predict this without extensive exposure to Aerys's bullshit?

I graduated in July '24. 

Ever since my mental health started declining because I couldn't leave the house due to some health problems. So I started relying on the roleplay chatbots... then I'd start reminiscing about my teenage years and how I could've handled them better. 

Until november. I've had enough and deleted the app but relapsed a month later. For 2026 I promised myself I would heal and get over my social anxiety and try befriending... so today I finally deleted my 2+ year old account. And I started feeling free.

I’ve also ditched the future-tense 'I will' and started writing **Weekly Monologues** in the past tense on Sunday nights.

I have been investing for the last two years majority of which is in debt and that too in FD. I have also been doing SIP in Nifty50 for 2 years but the amount is small . Since repo rates have gone down and me being in a higher tax bracket I feel the need to diversify my investment and take more risk if i need to get good returns in long term, So I have made a new year resolution to diversify my portfolio for 2026 and put more money in equity via MF SIP. This is what I have curated as a moderate investor based on my research of last 10 days. Please provide your valuable suggestions and alternatives if you have any. Apart from this I have also planned for 10K (60:30) in Gold & Silver ETF.

Total SIP : 45k

Platform : ET Money App

Goal: Diversification for Wealth creation

Bandhan Nifty 50 - 20k

Icici Next nifty 50 - 10k

Edelweiss Mid cap - 10k

And now here's the thing, there's no doubt that dating app fatigue is getting more and more entrenched (I don't think there will be many detractors) so perhaps dating apps might not cut it for 2026 anymore. If so, what are ways that you're planning to adopt to put yourselves out there and be in the dating pool? 

The thing with dating apps are that many people on it (both guys and girls) are using it the ""wrong way"" and they are plagued by what I call as the illusion of having many choices, and with that, everyone that you are going out with and giving a try will just be dismissed summarily at the slightest hint of some perceived incompatibility. What gives us this confidence to dismiss someone, it's exactly that, the illusion of choices!! As a guy, I will really love to bring back the old fashioned way in which you have a target, and you try your best courting her, and fortunately, I do have a target and I feel so liberated from being afflicted by the trappings of dating apps.

I have been investing for the last two years majority of which is in debt and that too in FD. I have also been doing SIP in Nifty50 for 2 years but the amount is small . Since repo rates have gone down and me being in a higher tax bracket I feel the need to diversify my investment and take more risk if i need to get good returns in long term, So I have made a new year resolution to diversify my portfolio for 2026 and put more money in equity via MF SIP. This is what I have curated as a moderate investor based on my research of last 10 days. Please provide your valuable suggestions and alternatives if you have any. Apart from this I have also planned for 10K (60:30) in Gold & Silver ETF.",5,Income & Financial Growth,Portfolio diversification into equity mutual funds and gold/silver ETFs,0.9,Plans to diversify investments into equity mutual funds and ETFs for higher long-term returns.,Positive,0.9

People can comment whatever they want, you can’t control the responses you get when posting on an open forum as I already said. You can try and tell people what you want all you like, that’s not how it works because others have opinions. If you aren’t prepared for all sorts of responses, don’t post. 

People posted out of concern for what to most looks like a pretty wild list of resolutions - resolutions generally being things we are going to achieve to completion, not just a guideline for things to work on in life. I know you replied to me to clarify but others obviously didn’t read that. 

Nobody is being nasty to you, there are no ‘negative’ comments, they just think your list is unrealistic - I think you’re over-reacting a bit here and your preachy ‘I achieved loads in 2025 so I’m going to continue and won’t be reading any more negativity’ was rude. We don’t know that. We don’t know these are just generic goals. You’ve literally labelled them ‘New Year Resolutions’ - the title would indicate you plan to start today, not that you already started a year ago. Your OP says ‘you wrote down your resolutions *for the new year*.

‘Launch ‘business’ by Spring’ - it’s not exactly a wild assumption to read that and assume you are planning to start a business in the next four months. Nowhere does it mention you already have a business and it’s just a product launch. 

People saw a typical impulsive ‘I’m going to completely turn my life around’ list and were showing concern that you’re taking on too much and will end up beating yourself up when you don’t achieve everything in full - because that’s what we do, probably that’s what most people who set ‘New Year’ resolutions do unless they’re forgotten after a week (like my husband who didn’t call it a resolution but planned to have a ‘dry’ January - we’re both sober so he’s talking about food, I laughed and said ‘what, dry and tasteless?’ and he rolled his eyes.. and at 12.33am, literally the first thing he ate this year, it was pizza). Your OP was short and vague and did not include any of the information you then replied to posts with. 

And you also got a bunch of comments breaking down your specific examples - but instead, you chose to focus on what you perceive to be negative. 

If you achieved so much in 2025 then why are you asking how to achieve in 2026? Just do what you did last year 🤷‍♀️",15,Other / Unclear,Forum response to posted resolutions,0.25,Meta-discussion about reactions; no clear resolution content.,Unclear,0.2

And yes, the list is still correct. Jackal is *the* arena unit, and new vesti is an incredible B3 for arena. Now as for your question:

Noah is one of the best B2s. She gens crazy amounts of burst, taunts enemies when she bursts, and turns literally invincible during that time. So unless your opponent has AoE/full squad damage, it is impossible to die.

Biscuit is often put alongside Jackal as the two most influential Arena units. Squads are build around *them*. You typically don't wanna put them on the same squad as it's overkill and they're best spread out, but yeah Biscuit is a mainstay

You can see the tier list, but others that are good are Anis (for burst gen), Centi (for burst gen), Blanc (for heals), and Trina (for acting as a budget Biscuit for Scarlet and Moran. Also burst gen)

Building for arena is a pain in the ass and it uses a lot of units that are generally... well, awful in PvE content. Best of luck climbing the ladder and getting that gem income.

608,LittleAnxiety3342,Jan 01 10:04:10 2026,Reddit Submission,"There were so many things that happened in the past year. Good and bad, both. I've disappointed people and vice versa. I've had truly great times as well. Last year made me realise something very important.

I've been struggling with understanding myself and what I want. Until last night, I didn't even think about the new year, resolutions, I didn't even care. But something happened, something changed without me consciously doing anything. I've tried so many times to be with people, to connect to them and it always ends up the same way– me leaving because of my issues and making them upset. Heartbroken, even. And I hate to do that but I can't just stay. At this point, I don't even make new friends online or in real life because I know what's going to happen. 

It's always been like that on a loop. Meet someone new, talk to them and realise I cannot handle trusting people completely and being attached to them. And then I leave. There's a part of me, a huge part that hates losing control of whatever situation I'm in. It makes me uneasy, the kind of uneasiness I can't handle. So, I lose interest and then, I leave. Of course, after that I feel alone and then I try talking to a new person. Because there's always that hope that perhaps now, it will be different. Maybe I'll finally find peace with someone. But it never comes. I can't take this hurt anymore, I can't let things like this keep happening. 

And I've accepted it. It's okay if that kind of peace and love is not for me. It's okay if I can't be close to anyone without hurting them and myself and inevitably leaving. I'm okay with not having that at all, I can live without that. Being alone is the best for me. I'm going to embrace it, work on myself, get rid of the insecurities and do what I really want to do.

I have a 1 stage Carrier furnace (59SC5B) and this thing is just too loud and heats up our house too quickly (\~2000 sqft). It’s loud, and some small rooms are heated up too quickly. I’d like to get something that is significantly quieter, and can operate at a lower regime.

A two stage furnace seems like a good option.

What are good solutions? What questions should I ask as I start to get some quotes?

The current furnace works well, so I feel bad for changing something that’s actually working. But I’m looking for something more comfortable for our family.

every year i write new year resolutions with full motivation, thinking this time it’ll stick.

and every year, about a month later, i genuinely can’t remember what i wrote.

once the initial excitement fades, the goals just disappear from daily life.



i ended up building a small personal tool called lockin26 to experiment with this idea,

but the bigger thing i’ve been thinking about is the product question behind it.



how much of “consistency” is really about motivation,

and how much is just about resurfacing the right things at the right time?

Last year, we tried to cover all the topics and important basic terms in it. We will modify the content and extend it with essential videos for DI and more useful techniques videos. Like, we will teach how to write information neatly and cleanly on A5-size (as given in the CAT exam hall) paper when too much information is given in the LR/DI Set, which will strengthen your basics completely.

999,Main_Internal_7017,Jan 01 07:04:02 2026,Reddit Submission,"Every year on Jan 1, people write the same things:

* “I want to earn more”
* “I want to be healthier”
* “I want to grow my business”
* “I want to be consistent”

And every year, most of it collapses by February.

Here’s what actually helped me (and others I’ve seen succeed):

**From Day 1 of 2026, don’t write what you want. Write what you’re willing to tolerate.**

Because your year won’t be defined by motivation.  
It will be defined by what you *allow to continue*.

Here are the 5 things worth writing on Jan 1:



**1. Write the behaviors you will no longer excuse**  
Not habits you want to build.  
Habits you’re done justifying.

Examples:

* “I stop saying I’m busy when I’m actually avoiding.”
* “I stop calling inconsistency ‘flexibility’.”
* “I stop blaming tools, algorithms, or people.”

If you don’t write this down, you’ll repeat it unconsciously.



**2. Write your personal “non-negotiables” (not goals)**  
Goals change. Standards don’t.

Examples:

* “I do the work even when results aren’t visible.”
* “I don’t abandon things halfway anymore.”
* “I finish what I start, even imperfectly.”

This matters more than ambition.



**3. Write what you will do on low-energy days**  
Most plans only work on high-motivation days.  
Those days are rare.

Write rules like:

* “On bad days, I still show up for 30 minutes.”
* “I don’t quit because a day was wasted.”

This single shift prevents 80% of failure.



**4. Write the distractions you’re consciously choosing to keep**  
Be honest. You’re not quitting everything.

Write:

* What you will still waste time on
* How much time you’ll allow
* When it becomes a problem again

If you don’t define it, distraction quietly becomes your lifestyle.



**5. Write one sentence you’ll reread when you want to quit**  
Not motivational. Real.

Examples:

* “Future me is built by boring repetition.”
* “Discomfort now is easier than regret later.”
* “This feeling passes. Quitting compounds.”

This sentence matters more than any planner.



**Final thought:**  
A successful 2026 won’t come from better planning.  
It will come from **less self-betrayal**.

If you write anything on Day 1, write the truth — not the fantasy.

# stats

height: 6’2 / 188 cm

weight: 79 kg / \~174 lbs

build: slim to athletic

shipping: **eastmallbuy**

line: **gd ems**

destination: singapore but travelling to europe and japan so need winter shi

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

this was a pretty big mixed haul, mostly winter pieces with some shoes and accessories. everything shipped via eastmallbuy using gd ems and it landed before new years which honestly surprised me in a good way. no damage, no missing items, and packaging was solid overall. a lot of these were bought through yupoo sellers and i used the agent to handle purchasing since some listings are annoying with blurred thumbnails. fit notes below are based on my stats above.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

# footwear

**black air force 1 max batch eu 47.5**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215731697?uid=1](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215731697?uid=1)

classic. shape is right, leather feels solid, and they fit my big feet properly which is always the main concern. max batch didn’t disappoint. these are beaters but still look clean.

**ultra boost 1 style eu 47.5**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/169263435?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4634383](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/169263435?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4634383)

actually shocked by these. comfort is insanely close to my retail ultra boost 1. boost feel, knit, and overall flex are almost identical. if you told me these were retail on foot i wouldn’t question it.

**mm6 gx batch salmon eu 46.5**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/214075197?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4512899](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/214075197?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4512899)

good shoe. color pops hard but still wearable. gx batch quality is solid and build feels premium. fits slightly snug so sizing down half was the right call.

**ugg x palace top batch for my girl**

yupoo: [https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215963143?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4679819](https://yolo66.x.yupoo.com/albums/215963143?uid=1&isSubCate=false&referrercate=4679819)

not for me but quality is there. suede feels soft, stitching clean, and shape matches retail refs well.

Day one of the chapter called 2026.

And honestly… it doesn’t feel any different. It just feels like another day.

There are no fears.

No regrets either.

Just this quiet feeling that says yeah, it was time well spent.

Learned a lot of things. Lost a lot of friends. Found a few new bonds.

In its own way, it was all worth it.

So now what?

That’s the question I have.

But I don’t really want to find the answer.

It’s strange this New Year doesn’t come with wonder or excitement.

It feels like only the date has changed.

What is there to celebrate, really?

And that’s not a bad thing.

It’s just this numb feeling that’s holding everything together.

It’s not just the New Year it’s my birthday too.

Yeah… I know.

But it’s not that exciting, to be honest.

Is this maturity?

Or just growing older?

There will be no New Year resolutions.

No new goals.

with its beautiful surprises and harsh lessons.

A few Stoic lessons that helped me:
1️⃣ Don’t fight your whole life at once.
Pick one habit that, if improved, would make everything else easier. Not “delete all apps,” but, for example:
20 minutes of reading before any social media.
Win that battle daily — momentum grows.

2️⃣ Trade restriction for replacement.
The Stoics didn’t avoid distraction by gritting teeth. They filled their attention with what nourished them.
Add before removing. Build before cutting.

3️⃣ Treat relapse as part of the design.
On day 3–4, most people fail… because they expect perfection.
A setback isn’t failure — it’s training.
Return to the path. That’s Stoicism.

4️⃣ Identity > motivation.
Instead of “I want to quit scrolling,” try:
I’m someone who chooses what deserves my attention.
Your actions begin to follow the story you tell.

5️⃣ Keep it fun, not punitive.
The Greeks trained their minds the way athletes trained their bodies — with joy in the process, not punishment for imperfection.

Every year gives us another chance to practice the same eternal truth:
Discipline isn’t a January event.

It’s a daily vote for the person you are becoming.

Wherever you start — start small, start kind, start now.

I made a bingo card based on Ilya and Shane (based on the show episodes) with similar activities they do in the show. I tried to choose activities that would well suit ""New Year resolution goals"" and that can be done just for fun 🥹 I do realize that some of the activities might not be the easiest to do, like the visiting cities ones. You can definitely replace any of the activities with ones that better suit your interests/plans for the year! And I tried to keep them pretty flexible, so for example, ""watch a hockey game"" can mean either in-person or through a screen.

Anyways, I hope this brings a little bit of joy to your life and convinces you to touch grass because this show (and the winter weather and the holidays) has been keeping me indoors which isn't super great for my mental health... And I want us to be able to enjoy the HR experience out into our lives too :)

1408,Kind_Computer_446,Jan 01 04:48:21 2026,Reddit Comment,"I liked your prompt but few things I wanna say that this prompt MIGHT BE AI generated or might be have problems you might have missed. You can improve these later on.

First of all it has strange syntaxes. 

For example in some texts it has this suppose there is something like ***Measurable***, but has syntax of ***M***easerable. Which is not necessary in A PROMPT. You could use capitalisation( Like ***MEASURABLE***), it saves token as AI does have to convert the ***M***easurable into Measurable.

Also the prompt has strange tables which I think ain't necessary, as they reduce context by forcing the AI to unnecessarily convert your table into a normal readable JSON data, and it burns token. 
It used ""|""  syntax for separating tasks, and sections. Which is also unnecessary, The AI ignores them, as they're not trained in data which uses "" | "" for separating tasks. You can use dashes like ""---"" to separates data or you can some just use brackets {...} or  [...]. As AIs are trained in a vast amount JSON DATA. 

Overall, I was just trying to advice your prompt, so that you can improve your prompt expertise. And I said it might be AI as AI uses strange tables, or strange syntaxes for generating a prompt. (Please don't mean it)

But yea, if you wrote the prompt, then your prompt was actually good, but I was just trying to say DON'T stop here, there's lot of room to improve. 
You could say, I was having an itch to advice someone for no reason that's why I advised you, JUST IGNORE IT, if you don't wanna listen to my advice (it's okay if you don't - just killing some time of  mine to do some good things instead of scrolling)",15,Other / Unclear,Prompt feedback and suggestions,0.2,"Feedback about prompt syntax and improvements, not a new year resolution.",Unclear,0.2
